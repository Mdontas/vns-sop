## Set Orienteering Problem dataset

The dataset is based on the one used in Claudia Archetti, Francesco Carrabs, Raffaele Cerulli, **The Set Orienteering**, published in the European Journal of Operational Research 2018.

```
@article{archetti18sop,
  author = "Claudia Archetti and Francesco Carrabs and Raffaele Cerulli",
  title = "The Set Orienteering Problem",
  journal = "European Journal of Operational Research",
  volume = "267",
  number = "1",
  pages = "264 - 272",
  year = "2018",
  issn = "0377-2217",
  doi = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.009",
  url = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221717310202",
}
```

The original dataset is enriched by defining both the START_SET add END_SET ids of sets to start and to end tour.


Originally the dataset is based on instances for the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem proposed in:
```
@article{fischetti97gtsp,
  author = {Fischetti, Matteo and Salazar González, Juan José and Toth, Paolo},
  title = {A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Symmetric Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem},
  journal = {Operations Research},
  volume = {45},
  number = {3},
  pages = {378-394},
  year = {1997},
  doi = {10.1287/opre.45.3.378},
}
